			bio: "I’m driven by a computational view of the world, with research focused on bridging natural sciences and AI. My PhD centers on Natural Computationalism, integrating theories like Wolfram’s Principle of Computational Equivalence and Zenil’s Computable Universe Thesis. Under guidance from experts at Oxford, UNAM, and Gothenburg, I’ve published on topics from consciousness to algorithmic probability, challenging conventional model-building with efficient, rule-based approaches inspired by Turing. Currently, I’m contributing to a startup focused on democratizing decision-making through AI, shifting from complex datasets to streamlined, rule-based models.",
